                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Introduced in one thousand nine hundred one, the thirty-five hp was designed by Wilhelm Maybach and Paul Daimler (Gottlieb Daimler's son). It represented a major departure from previous car designs, which bore a close resemblance to horse carriages. The 35 hp became a dominant racing machine thanks to its reliability and powerful engine.</p>

                <button class="accordion">What was the first sports car?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Many of the world's motoring historians have acclaimed the 'Prince Henry' Vauxhall as the very first sports car. Designed by much-admired Vauxhall engineer Laurence Pomeroy, this car was named after Pomeroy's success with the twenty hp A-type in the thousand nine hundred ten Tour of Prussia an event instigated by Prince Henry of Prussia.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>It is not uncommon for regular sports cars to crack two hundred mph these days, speeds only a handful of supercars could crack just fiveteen years ago. While two hundred mph seems easy these days, cars that top two hundred and fifty+ mph need brute force and incredible engineering on another level.</p>
